# Communicate-Data-Findings
# Introduction
This project is part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree Program and serves as practice for data visualization. This document explores a dataset containing information about Prosper's loan data. Prosper is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with over $9 billion in funded loans. This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan.

# Summary and Conclusion
It seems that there are a lot of nulls for most of the variables in the dataset since I'm only interested to investigate some of the features from this dataset, I will subset the dataframe to extract the features of interest for my analysis and remove the nulls for this subset dataframe only
After reading through the descriptions and definitions, I chose ['Term', 'LoanStatus', 'BorrowerRate', 'ProsperRating (Alpha)', 'ListingCategory (numeric)',
              'EmploymentStatus','DelinquenciesLast7Years', 'StatedMonthlyIncome', 'TotalProsperLoans',
              'LoanOriginalAmount','LoanOriginationDate', 'Recommendations', 'Investors','BorrowerAPR','ProsperScore',
            'Occupation','IncomeRange' ]
However by combining these variables I think we should be able to gather some interesting insights and better understanding our borrowers.

# Variable Defintions
Taken from our Prosper Loan Data - Columns Definitions.csv that was provided with the dataset I will now define the individual variables i have selected for my analysis:
Term: The length of the loan expressed in months.
LoanStatus:The current status of the loan: Cancelled,  Chargedoff, Completed, Current, Defaulted, FinalPaymentInProgress, PastDue. The PastDue status will be accompanied by a delinquency bucket.
BorrowerRate:The Borrower's interest rate for this loan. 
ProsperRating (Alpha):The Prosper Rating assigned at the time the listing was created between AA - HR.  Applicable for loans originated after July 2009.

Occupation:The Occupation selected by the Borrower at the time they created the listing.
EmploymentStatusDuration:The length in months of the employment status at the time the listing was created.

# Key Insights for Presentation

Insights from the multivariate exploration data
For Applicants with prosper ratings from AA to D have the higher loan amount with increased salary
Employed and full time employees have their mean salaries in higher range
Majority of the borrowers are falling under prosper rating of B , irrespective of the income range
The monthly income of borrowers are having higher values for employed, other and full time employment status
with the prosper rating of AA, A and B
We can also clearly observe that HR prosper rating applicants have higher interest rates
To conclude this analysis , I say that the loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on IncomeRange, and employment status.
