# Key Insights for the Presentation
There are total of 113937 loans entries saved in the dataset and 81 attributes. Each loan contain information on the borrowered's background information and details regarding the loans.This analysis will focus on years between (2010 and 2013) and factors that are related to Prosper loans status (LoanStatus).

For the presentation, I mainly focused on the features that are impactful for approval of loan status. So for this I looked at the distribution of each and every numeric and categorical variables and did all the necessary univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis on selected variables.


# Key Insights for Presentation
- For Applicants with prosper ratings from AA to D have the higher loan amount with increased salary
Employed and full time employees have their mean salaries in higher range.
- Irrespective of the income range
The monthly income of borrowers are having higher values for employed, other and full time employment status
with the prosper rating of AA, A and B.
- LoanStatus of all Borrowers are with current and completed state.
- Longer term loans have on average lower APR.
- Top IncomeRange of all Borrowers are within $25,000-49,999.
- Most of the borrower have a fairly low Prosper Score of 4 (custom risk score) while the majority of the customer have a score between 5-8. You can also see that even customers with the low risks score of 1 or 2 did get a loan from Prosper. Furthermore, not many borrowers received the highest score of 10.
- The Income Range of the borrower seem not to have an impact on the outcome of the loan.
- The majority (~50,000) of people who currenly has a loan are empolyed no matter what is their ProsperScore.
- Plots also show that BorrowerRate has a negative relationship with LoanOriginalAmount and has a postive relationship with ProsperScore.

To conclude this analysis , I say that the loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on IncomeRange, and employment status.
