# Key Insights for the Presentation
For the presentation, I mainly focused on the features that are impactful for approval of loan status. So for this I looked at the distribution of each and every numeric and categorical variables and did all the necessary univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis on selected variables.


# Key Insights for Presentation
-For Applicants with prosper ratings from AA to D have the higher loan amount with increased salary
Employed and full time employees have their mean salaries in higher range.
- Irrespective of the income range
The monthly income of borrowers are having higher values for employed, other and full time employment status
with the prosper rating of AA, A and B.
- LoanStatus of all Borrowers are with current and completed state.
- Longer term loans have on average lower APR.
- 2013 - 2014 Prosper Score follows a gradual transition from purple to yellow, investors seemed to have really adopted this risk rating.
- 2011 onwards max APR has dropped from above 40% to slightly above 36% .
- Top IncomeRange of all Borrowers are within $50,000-74,999 .




To conclude this analysis , I say that the loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on IncomeRange, and employment status.
